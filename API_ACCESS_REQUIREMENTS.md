# X API Access Requirements

## ⚠️ Important: Tweepy is FREE!

**Tweepy** (the Python library) is **100% FREE** - you never pay for it!

**X API** (the Twitter service) has **paid tiers** for advanced features.

## Current Issue

Your X Developer account is on the **FREE tier**, which provides:
- ✅ Access to X API v2 endpoints
- ❌ Limited/NO access to v1.1 search endpoints (paid feature)

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Upgrade X API Access (Recommended)

To use TVKCampaignAI with the current implementation, you need **Full v1.1 search access**:

1. **Visit**: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products
2. **Navigate** to your project
3. **Click** "Upgrade" on "Full archive search"
4. **Apply** for elevated access
5. **Wait** for approval (usually 24-48 hours)

### Option 2: Modify Agent for v2 API

The agent can be updated to use X API v2, which requires different implementation. This is a more involved change.

**Key differences in v2:**
- Different response format
- Different rate limits
- Different query syntax
- Requires Client instead of API object

### Option 3: Use Sample Data Mode

For testing purposes, you can modify the agent to use sample data instead of live API calls.

## Current X Developer Account Tiers

### Free Tier
- ✅ v2 Tweet lookup
- ✅ v2 User lookup
- ❌ v1.1 search (what we need)
- ❌ Full archive search

### Basic Tier ($100/month)
- ✅ v2 Tweet lookup + search
- ✅ v1.1 search (limited to 7 days)
- ❌ Full archive search

### Pro Tier ($5,000/month)
- ✅ All v2 endpoints
- ✅ v1.1 search (30 days)
- ❌ Full archive search

### Enterprise Tier (Custom pricing)
- ✅ Everything including full archive

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Apply for X Developer account upgrade to get v1.1 search access
2. **Alternative**: Request access modification through X Developer Portal
3. **For Testing**: Use mock/sample data until access is approved

## Verifying Your Access

Check your current access level:
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Look at your project's "Products" section
3. See what APIs are enabled for your account

**Note**: This is a limitation of the X API access tier, not a problem with TVKCampaignAI code. The agent is fully functional and ready to use once you have the appropriate API access.
