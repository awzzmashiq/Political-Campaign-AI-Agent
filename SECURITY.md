# 🔒 Security Notice

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Credentials Were Exposed

**Date**: October 31, 2025

This repository previously contained hardcoded X (Twitter) API credentials in several files. These credentials have been removed and replaced with placeholders.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. Removed hardcoded credentials from:
   - `app.py`
   - `example.py`
   - `START_HERE.md`
   - `API_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md`

2. Updated all files to use:
   - Environment variables (`.env` file)
   - Placeholder values
   - Security best practices

## 🔐 Immediate Actions Required

### If You're Using These Credentials:

**URGENT**: Rotate all your X API credentials IMMEDIATELY!

1. Go to [X Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com)
2. Navigate to your app/project
3. Go to "Keys and tokens"
4. **Regenerate** all credentials:
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
   - Bearer Token

5. Update any applications using these credentials

## 📝 Using This Repository Safely

### Recommended: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`):

```env
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret_here
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
```

Never commit this file!

### Alternative: Manual Input

Use the UI to manually enter credentials each time.

## 🚫 Security Best Practices

1. ✅ **NEVER** commit credentials to Git
2. ✅ Use environment variables
3. ✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

5. ✅ Don't share credentials publicly
6. ✅ Use different credentials for dev/prod
